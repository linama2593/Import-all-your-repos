Ever wanted to have all your GitHub repositories neatly organized on your local machine? Look no further! 🖥️💻

With this python code, now you can import **ALL** your repositories **at once** into a local folder, making it a breeze to work offline or keep a backup handy. 📦🔒

*   Make sure you already have set up Git in your local machine
*   You will need a GitHub Token - Instructions below:
      1. Go to 'Settings' on your GitHub profile
      2. Select 'Developer Settings'
      3. Select 'Peronal Access Tokens'
      4. Select 'Fine-grained personal access tokens'
      5. Click on 'Generate New Token'
      6. Enter your GitHub password
      7. Configure the token how you prefer or how you need it
      8. Once you have the token, you are good to go!

*   Follow the instructions inside the 'import_github_repos.py' file. I put in capital letters the info you need to update in the .py file

**DISCLAIMER**: If a repository has multiple branches, this code imports by **default** the **main branch**. You may **not** be able to import **private** repositories
